Linux matrix mixer for RME cards (WIP)
--------------------------------------

This is still work in progress. Commit messages and code quality are sub-standard, I've only pushed
it to github to have a backup.

If you want your card added, feel free to adopt the code.

In any case, I'd be happy to hear from you (either via github or mail to adi@drcomp.erfurt.thur.de)
